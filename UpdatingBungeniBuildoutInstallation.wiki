Updating a buildout installation is quite easy. 

If anything changed in the configuration files for the buildout (in our case, `buildout.cfg` and `dependencies.cfg`), you need to re-run buildout. To do this without making it check for newer versions of distributions, run `./bin/buildout -N` (see `./bin/buildout --help` for this and other options).

Running `svn up` from the buildout root folder will update all the products under `develop-products` and `vendor-products.` 

To update selective products, run `svn up` from the specific product folder. For e.g. to update just `develop-products/Bungeni` run `svn up` from that folder. Note that this only makes sense for products where you're working on *trunk* or on a *branch*; i.e. not on a specific revision or tag. Generally, this *should* only be the case for products under active development.

Finally, depending on the nature of the changes to the product, you may have to reinstall or upgrade the product via "Plone->Site Setup->Add/Remove Products". If the product defines workflows and the site has lots of content, the upgrade may take a long time as security settings is updated on all that content.
