= Introduction =

This page documents typical problems in Bungeni - and suggests resolutions to these issues.

== Bungeni Starts up but unable to browse to the service ==

Bungeni can be browsed on port 8081 but the portal interface (8080) cannot be accessed even though the portal service is running -- 

* check the host and port entries in the deploy.ini file for the portal - If they are bound to a specific IP then you must browse Bungeni using that IP.


== PDF conversion does not work in Bungeni ==

PDF conversion does not work in Bungeni
 * Check if the OpenOffice service is started in the background : 
{{{
 $ps aux | grep soffice
 /usr/bin/soffice -accept=socket,port=2002;urp; -nologo -nofirststartwizard -headless
}}}

 * Check if supporting software for pdf conversion is installed - e.g libtidy :
{{{
sudo apt-get install libtidy-dev
}}}

 * PDF conversion will not work with custom installed openoffice installations -e.g. if you install the version of OOo from the openoffice.org website. You must use the Openoffice installation packaged with Ubuntu.
