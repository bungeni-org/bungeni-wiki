= Introduction =

Bungeni Transcribe is a simple VLC plugin for transcribing parliamentary proceedings and saving them to a XML file. It is particularly useful when used together with the VLC scale-tempo plugin that supports speeding up or slowing audio while maintaining constant pitch.

= TO DO =
== Intergrating with rest of Bungeni ==
The main idea is to make transcription as fast and as simple as possible. One way to do this is to make it such that transcribers do not have to login in to the Bungeni Portal manually and download the videos they are supposed to transcribe. Proposed functionality will work in the following way
1. user specifies his/her bungeni username and password as well as domain name or ip address of bungeni server on the plugins preference page
2. plugin downloads an xml file that contains all the segments that the transcriber is supposed to work on
3. plugin downloads the media files specified in the xml files
4. user transcribes the video
5. plugin in uploads transcripts to bungeni server
