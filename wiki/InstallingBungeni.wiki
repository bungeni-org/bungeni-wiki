#summary How to install a development instance of Bungeni
#labels Featured

In order to install it, use buildout. These steps should be all you need to setup a Zope instance with all the required products and libraries:

{{{
$ svn co http://bungeni-portal.googlecode.com/svn/bungeni.buildout/trunk/
bungeni
$ cd bungeni
$ python bootstrap.py
$ ./bin/buildout  # wait a while..
$ ./bin/instance start
}}}

The buildout includes DeadlockDebugger, so if you start Zope in debug mode, it will stop at a debugger prompt if an exception is raised. 

Next you have to add a Plone instance and configure it. 
  * Add a plone site,
  * browse to `portal_setup` in the new instance. 
  * Go to the _Properties_ tab, select the `membrane` profile; go to the _Import_ tag, select _Import all steps_; 
  * go back to the _Properties_ tab, select the `remember` profile; go to the _Import_ tag, select _Import all steps_ again. 
  * Go to the Plone view of the instance, go to the setup area, and install the Bungeni product. This will automatically install the dependencies. 
  * If you would like demo content to play with, install the BungeniDefaultContent product. (It raises an exception just as it's done. This is a quick'n'dirty way of enabling to you rerun it to re-add deleted content.)
