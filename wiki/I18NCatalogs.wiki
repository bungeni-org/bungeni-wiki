= Setup i18n scripts =

due to a minor issue in one of the recipes used in buildout, we need to modify the generated i18n scripts to include the path to our xapian library.

so after running buildout you'll need to add an additional 

 '$buildout_directory/parts/xapian/lib/python' 

to the list at the top of the bin/i18nextract script, substituting the full path for $buildout_directory. after which you can use the i18nextract script to generate a message catalog (pot file) for translation.
