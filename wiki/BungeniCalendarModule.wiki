#summary This documents the requirements of the Parliamentary Calendar for Bungeni within Plone.

= Introduction =
The parliamentary calendar is one of the main metadata registries of Bungeni PIS.  The calendar provides a map of all parliamentary activities for the forthcoming year.

= Similar Examples = 

A calendar of public committee meetings, etc from the Parliament.UK website:

  http://www.parliament.uk/what_s_on/hoc_news3.cfm

The calendar must also provide a summarized, typical calendar style view.
Note that the calendar provided in the example is a subset of the main parliamentary calendar which records all activities.

= Plone products =

There are various plone calendar products available. They could be modified for use by the PIS.

= Calendar Storage - ZoDB vs RDBMS table =

We have a need to capture the calendar data in a relational table - so that the information can be cross-referenced / joined with other registry metadata tables.
The Plone calendar products by default use zodb storage.
For Bungeni we could still use the zodb storage, but just at the point of a state transition (new insertion, updation or deletion) insert a subset of the same data into a relational database table (which essentially then synchronizes with the plone calendar./...)
