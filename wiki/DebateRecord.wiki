The Bungeni Plone product facilitates creation of the debate record. 

The record is produced per sitting. Production proceeds as follows:
 * For a sitting, a Rota folder is created. This folder is populated with !RotaItems based on the defaults configured in the RotaTool, and the active membership of the DebateRecordOffice.
 * The generated rota can be edited (items may be reassigned, reporters may be added or removed).
 * When the rota is finalised, it is sent by email to subscribed parties (configured on the RotaTool).
 * Once the rota has been finalised, Takes may be uploaded to the portal. By default, each Take is assigned to the next rota item in sequence. Takes are audio snippets of the parliamentary proceedings (see also FunctionalSystemRequirements).
 * Reporters see a worklist with assigned takes. They create an initial transcription of their takes, using OpenOffice via ExternalEditor. 
 * Submitted transcriptions are aggregated and presented for annotation using Marginalia. 
 * Annotated transcriptions are edited and formally marked up using the OpenOffice BungeniEditorClient. 
 * When the edited transcriptions are finalised in Bungeni, they are published to the eXist XML database.
