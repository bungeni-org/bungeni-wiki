How to add Objects to the DB schema


= Details =

The database schema is defined in the file bungeni.core/bungeni/core/schema.py

to add a table you define the table in python like:
{{{
provinces = rdb.Table(
    "provinces",
    metadata,
    rdb.Column( "province_id", rdb.Integer, primary_key=True ),
    rdb.Column( "province", rdb.Unicode(80), nullable=False ),
    )
}}}

after you changed the file the db has to be rebuilt with
be sure all connections to the db are closed.

bin/reset_db

(in my tests this failed sometimes so I had to manually drop the db)
bin/psql bungeni
> drop database

after that reset_db worked.
