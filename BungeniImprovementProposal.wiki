#summary How to document proposed improvements to Bungeni
#labels Phase-Implementation,Phase-Design

= Intro = 

See http://plone.org/products/plone/roadmap/0 for a quick motivation and plenty of examples.

We'll use the [http://code.google.com/p/bungeni-portal/issues/list issue tracker] for BIPs.

= Template = 

A BIP (Bungeni Improvement Proposal) should have the following structure:

== Proposed by ==

We can assume that the proposal is being made by the person creating the issue.

== Proposal type ==

User interface, architecture, integration ..

== Assigned to release ==

If this has been discussed, there will be a _Milestone-_ label in the
tracker for the release. If not, label as _Milestone-Unscheduled_.

== State ==

One of: 'being discussed', 'in progress', 'ready for merge', 'completed'.

== Motivation ==

Why does this proposal exist and what problem does it solve?

== Proposal ==

The proposed functionality in enough detail to understand the intended
way of usage.

== Implementation ==

Details regarding the implementation.

== Risks ==

Areas about which uncertainty exists, that may influence the
implementation choices made, or that may impact other areas of the
system.

== Progress log ==

The progress log will take the form of follow-ups to the issue
representing the BIP.

== Participants ==

The developers who are involved in the design and implementation of this
BIP.
